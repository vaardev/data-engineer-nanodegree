1.Introduction

A music streaming service, called Sparkify, has become more popular. This not only grew their user base, but also their song database. Because of this growth, they would like to move their processes and data onto the cloud. The data for both song details and user activity are currently stored in JSON files.
The main objectif is to use Amazon Web Services S3 and Redshift to make the ETL process from raw log files of the Sparkify app to a database schema that provides analytical data to be queried.

2.Configuration

You'll need to patch following AWS services using AWS services patch jupyter notebook (adatptation from Lesson 3: Implementing DataWarehouses in AWS):

    1.Assign IAM Role for Redshift in order to establish a process flow with other AWS services (in our project:S3) 
    
    2.Assign AWS Redshift Cluster services;
    
    3.Get Redshift clusters properties;
    
    4.Add allow rule in Cluster Security Group to enable access to Redshift port;
    
    5.Test using the same connection statement as we have in etl.py and create_table.py;
    
3. ETL Process

There are 2 python scripts which could be run using Script_Command jupyter notebook:

    !python create_tables.py - Creates or recreates tables and it will drop the tables if exists;
    !python etl.py - This script initiates 2 activities:
    
  ->Copy (load) the logs from the dataset's S3 bucket to the staging tables;
  ->Translate all data from the staging tables to the analytical tables with INSERT and SELECT statements.

4. Validation the results

Validation process is initiated using Data validation jupyter notebook:
    ->In this notebook we assess each table uploaded in cluster Redshift by number of rows ;
